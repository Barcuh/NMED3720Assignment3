This creative filter face tracking program features a dynamic process that shifts dependant on mouth movement. The filters used are representation of the current mood of the user. If you reach a “smile” threshold you activate the alternate version of the current filter. Once the threshold is reached the background and foreground shifts into a happy mood. The opposite is true and the default option. I’ve wanted to utilize the face tracking software to determine one’s mood. This may not be the true description of the user’s mood but gives a generalized observation/representation. This application can be expanded to include other moods such as tired, angry, uncomfortable, etc. but due to the time limitation before the submission deadline these features were not implemented.
